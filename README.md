# Reading List of Computer Science Publications

This repository is a list of computer science literature recommended for reading to improve your skillset. It is actually not a comprehensive list of all computer science literature, more like a list of literature that I have read and found personally useful.

    Please notice: This repository does not include a copy of the literature due to copyright limitiations. It provides a set of links to access the literature under the permission of the authors.

If you think the list misses some important literature, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Structure

As of today, the repository is organized by professional fields. Each folder is a list of literature in a specific area and contains a README.md file that describes the list of literature more in detail.

## How to Read

There are plenty of ways to read the literature and it highly depends on your personal preference. However, the wrong approach might lead to a waste of time. 
I can recommend the *tripple-pass method* as proposed by a bunch of academic researchers (e.g., ["How to Read a Paper by S. Keshav](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1273445.1273458) or  [How To Read Research Papers Effectively by Prof. David Stuckler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVv2jWXW0K4&ab_channel=Prof.DavidStuckler)):

0. **Perparation:** Answer the following questions:
    - Why are you reading this paper? 
    - What do you want to get out of it?

1. **First pass - "The Bird's Eye View":** (approx. 5-10 minutes)
    - Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
    - Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore the details.
    - Read the conclusion and the summary.
    - Glance over the references and the bibliography.

    - At the end, you should have a rough idea of what the paper is about.
        * What type of paper it is?
        * What are the paper's main contributions (high-level)?
        * Which other papers is it related to?
        * Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
        * Is the paper well-written?

2. **Second pass - "Swooping in the Body":** (approx. 10-15 minutes)
    - Dive into the parts of the body of the paper and extract the core details.
    - Look carefully at the figures, tables, diagrams, etc.
    - Mark relevant unread references for further reading.
    - Extract information about the debate, what are key findings, and what are the main conclusions.

    - At the end, you should have a good understanding of the paper's main contributions and the core details.

3. **Third pass - "The Details":**  (approx. 60-120 minutes or even longer)
Sometimes it is necessary to fully understand the paper, particularly if you are a reviewer, where you need to understand every piece about the actual methodology, approach, etc. the authors used. For this you need a third pass.

    - Key is to attempt *virtually re-implement* the paper.
    - Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement made by the authors.
    - Think about how yourself would present the paper.
